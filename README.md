This is a short personal project that I started with my friend for fun. My friend is a realtor (doesn't do programming) and he asked me to program this site. I designed and wrote it in 4 days. It's a completely static website that sends out email to my friend's email account if a user fills out the form. I decided this is a better approach for this project than a traditional backend or database (no need for AWS Lambdas or other similar solutions). Because I knew the page would be quite small I had less motivation to keep the code clean everywhere.
